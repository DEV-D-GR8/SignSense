# ASL Recognition Transformer Model

This repository contains a transformer-based model for real-time American Sign Language (ASL) recognition. The model leverages state-of-the-art transformer architecture to accurately interpret ASL gestures and utilizes the Gemini-Pro LLM API for constructing sentences from recognized ASL signs. The system supports live video input for seamless, on-the-fly translation of ASL gestures into textual form, aiding communication accessibility.

## Project Overview
This project aims to provide a robust solution for real-time ASL recognition using a transformer-based deep learning model. The model captures live video input, processes the frames to detect and recognize ASL gestures, and constructs meaningful sentences from the recognized words using the Gemini-Pro LLM API. This tool can significantly enhance communication for individuals who use ASL.

## Features
- **Real-time ASL Recognition**: Detect and recognize ASL gestures in real-time.
- **Transformer Architecture**: Utilizes advanced transformer models for high accuracy.
- **Sentence Construction**: Integrates with Gemini-Pro LLM API to build sentences from recognized signs.
- **Live Video Input**: Supports live video input for seamless ASL translation.
